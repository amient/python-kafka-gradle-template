# building python programs with gradle

## First time on a development machine

    ./bin/python-setup-mac.sh

This will generate a local repository mirror of pypi converted to ivy format (gradle doesn't undersatnd pypi format):
    
    ~/pypi-ivy


## each program has to then have a setup.py

A template of `setup.py` can be generated by `generateSetupPy` for example:

 `./gradlew :module:python-kafka-consumer:generateSetupPy`.

After the initial setup.py is generated the setup() function needs to be modified with the correct entry point
to your program.

setup.py then can be comitted to the repository and afterwards doesn't have to be regenerated again.


## building is simple afterwards

For example:

    ./gradlew :python-kafka-consumer:build

## running the application using generated venv

    ./python-kafka-consumer/build/venv/bin/example_avro_consumer
